OpenHealth has only so many resources to explore the vast space of autonomous self-care.  The community we cultivate here will always have a limited focus.  Demands to shift communal focus will always outpace the willingness to shift communal focus.  This attention mismatch traditionally has caused friction in open source efforts.   To maximize the principles of self-care, OpenHealth will be heavily utilizing Github's fork feature.

Instead of partaking in [holy wars to command communal focus](https://www.gwern.net/Holy-wars), the fork allows a pioneering individual or group to copy OpenHealth community source and bylaws to run their own self-care research hub.  Due to the MIT license, they are free to adjust the code as they see fit.  If OpenHealth sees these pioneers achieving traction and results, then these efforts can be brought into the _foundation_ to improve all other efforts.  The goal is to make the OpenHealth research effort psychologically [self-hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)).

Instead of using influence operations to control communal focus, forking allows results to improve communal focus.  [Pioneer your fork today!](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/OpenHealth/fork)
